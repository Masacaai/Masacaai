### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Masacaai/Masacaai** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating a minesweeper clone and training a neural network to play it
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning assembly programming and PyTorch
- :computer: Check out my website where I (sometimes) run a blog! --> https://aaqel.xyz
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: (He/Him)
- âš¡ Fun fact: My favourite CS concept from what I've learned so far is linked lists and the use of pointers. It makes life so much easier when you're able to redirect a pointer rather than having to  individually swap data from two different containers.
